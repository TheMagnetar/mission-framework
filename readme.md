# Mission Framework (UMF)

<p align="center">
    <sup><strong>Requires the latest version of <a href="https://github.com/CBATeam/CBA_A3/releases">CBA A3</a>.<br/></strong></sub>
</p>

Mission Framework (MF) is a mission framework designed to simplify the mission editing created during my time at Unidad de Simulación Táctica 101 (UST101). It allows the mission maker to have more focus on mission designing by removing the need of dealing with init lines and scripts. Instead of provinding all the scripts in a template folder, the addon approach allows a cleaner mission folder that can be easily updated without having to modify it.

In addition the mission framework focuses on core functionality, leaving other functionality like AI and spawning out of its scope.

## Features

- Gear scripts integrated with 3DEN editor.
- ACE3 configuration.
